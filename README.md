This repository is composed of the projects I completed through Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.
This program gave me the opportunity to further explore my interest in data analysis. During the course of this program, I learned how to organize data, wrangling, basic scraping, A-B testing, and communicating critical data findings. I also added my certificate of a prerequisite course, Programming for Data Science Nanodegree.

README documents are attached each of the project folders.
